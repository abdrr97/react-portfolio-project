            Hello, I am John Doe and I am a web developer. I live and work in somewhere warm. I
            spend most of my day, experimenting with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (and its endless list
            of frameworks). I enjoy coding and the challenge of learning something new everyday. You
            can also find me at youtube channel
